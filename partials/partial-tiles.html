  <h3>Great job!</h3>
  <p>As you can tell, the 1943 and 50s were a time of great expansion for the Hartzold farmstead.</p>
  <p>In 1957 Ed Hartzold and his wife moved out of the family farmhouse to make way for his son, Bob (who was now in charge of the farm) and his new wife Marian. Bob and Marian raised two sons and six daughters here.</p>
  <p>In addition to the 240 acre family farm, Bob rented another 340 acres of farmland. On his land he grew a rotation of corn, soybeans, hay, oats, and occasionally wheat.</p>
  <p>By this time the farm was completely mechanized.  The barn no longer housed horses but the loft was still filled with hay for their cattle.</p>
